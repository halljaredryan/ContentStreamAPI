# Resume Project Summary

## FastAPI Media Management API

• **Designed and developed a production-ready RESTful API** using FastAPI and Python 3.13, implementing a comprehensive media management system with asynchronous database operations and cloud-based file storage integration

• **Architected RESTful endpoints** (`POST /upload`, `GET /feed`, `DELETE /posts/{post_id}`) following industry-standard HTTP methods and status codes, with dependency injection for database session management and proper error handling using HTTPException

• **Integrated ImageKit CDN** for scalable media storage and delivery, supporting both image and video uploads with automatic file type detection and unique file naming

• **Implemented async/await patterns** throughout the application using SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession for non-blocking database operations, ensuring high performance and scalability

• **Leveraged Pydantic models** for request/response validation and type safety, maintaining clean separation between API contracts and business logic

• Built with modern Python tooling (uv, aiosqlite) and configured with environment-based configuration management for secure credential handling
