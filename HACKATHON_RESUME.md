## University of Cincinnati Hackathon - Browser Guessing Game

• **Collaborated in a 4-person agile team** to architect and develop a Wordle-inspired browser-based guessing game within a 24-hour hackathon timeframe, utilizing Python for RESTful backend services and JavaScript/CSS for responsive frontend interactions

• **Designed and integrated RESTful API endpoints** to fetch real-time data from external APIs, implementing data transformation logic to format responses for game statistics and validation requirements

• **Built a full-stack web application** with separation of concerns between backend game logic and frontend presentation layer, ensuring maintainable code architecture under time constraints

• **Deployed and demonstrated a production-ready prototype** with live gameplay during the hackathon presentation, showcasing end-to-end functionality from API data retrieval to user interaction
